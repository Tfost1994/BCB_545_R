## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```
You have inspected the data thoroughly. The code ran without any interuption in my computer. 
You have explained each step and took necessary caution before each step to check the data format and use the right code. 
The codes are precise and without redundancy. 
In data visualization, the step to make sure the numbers were in order is great!
You did a good job analyzing the data by looking at the graphs as well.
Your choice to look at the GC content is relevant and might help understand the correlation between GC content and occurence of SNPs in the groups.
I have only one suggestion on visualizing the total number of snps in maize and teosinte groups: It will be interesting to look at it by converting it into a long file and see how many of those individual SNPs are present in the maize group and teosinte group. (Hint: try using pivot_longer)

Overall you have done a great job with the codes and explained each step clearly, and also generated colourful and well labeled plots.
